No-Stop-File-Copier
===================

No Stop File Copier is simply a file copier that copies all the files from a given input folder to a given output folder. If a file already exists, it is overwritten by the new file. Once the operation is completed, the user is notified via a .wav file being played. Created by Craig Lotter, July 2006
