No Stop File Copier
===================

No Stop File Copier is simply a file copier that copies all the files from a given input folder to a given output folder. If a file already exists, it is overwritten by the new file. Once the operation is completed, the user is notified via a .wav file being played.

No Stop File Copier is intended for unattended copying. Should No Stop File Copier come across an unreadable file and an error is thrown, the program simply moves on to the next file without requiring user interaction.
